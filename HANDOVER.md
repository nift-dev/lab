# HANDOVER.md
v0.0.8

This is a living handover for working effectively in a Nift project.

Canonical version:

https://nift.dev/HANDOVER.md

Check the version at the top of this file against the canonical copy when the
project is old, unfamiliar, or behaving differently from the current Nift
documentation.

To replace this file with the latest canonical version:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://nift.dev/HANDOVER.md -o HANDOVER.md
```

If this project has project-specific additions, preserve or reapply them when
updating the canonical handover.

This project uses Nift as part of its website build process.

Nift is the project's build-time templating and dependency layer. It does not determine what the website is about or what other technologies the project should use.

Keep the existing project architecture and use the project's normal HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, backend, and other tooling where appropriate.

Do not introduce Nift-specific machinery where ordinary web tooling is the clearer solution.

## Start here

Before making substantial changes:

1. Inspect `.nift/config.json` and `.nift/tracked.json`.
2. Inspect the existing `content/`, `templates/`, and output structure.
3. Read this project's `README.md` and other project-specific documentation.
4. Run:

```sh
nift status
```

During normal development, build frequently:

```sh
nift build
```

Use this throughout a task, not only at the end. Rebuild after meaningful
changes so Nift can surface template, path, dependency, configuration, and
tracking errors while the cause is still obvious.

In particular, run `nift build` immediately after editing
`.nift/config.json` or `.nift/tracked.json`.

Use:

```sh
nift status
```

when you want to inspect what Nift considers stale and why.

Successful `nift build` output may include indented `↳ ...` lines explaining
why a page was considered stale and rebuilt, such as a missing generated output
or a changed dependency. These are rebuild reasons, not errors. Actual build
failures are reported as errors and cause the build to fail.

Do not delete or recreate `.nift/`.

## Nift's core template model

Most Nift websites need very little Nift-specific syntax.

The three primitives you will use most often are:

```text
@content
@input(...)
@path(...)
```

`@content` inserts the tracked page's content into its template.

```html
<main>
    @content
</main>
```

`@content` should execute exactly once across the rendered template/input graph
for a tracked page. It is normally placed in the page's template; the tracked
content file supplies the content inserted there.

Content files may still use other Nift syntax when needed. If page text needs
to display Nift syntax literally, prefix the active sigil with `\` rather than
leaving it as template syntax:

```html
<code>\@content</code>
<code>\@path('about')</code>
<code>\$[title]</code>
```

This applies whenever `@...`, `$[...]`, or other Nift syntax is intended as
literal output rather than something Nift should execute or resolve.

`@input(...)` inserts a reusable file and automatically makes it a dependency of the output using it.

```html
@input('templates/header.html')

<main>
    @content
</main>

@input('templates/footer.html')
```

### Structured JSON and markup sources

Use name-first `@json` when a template needs immutable structured data:

```text
@json(name, path)
@json(name, schema-path, path)
@json(name, schema-name, path)
@json(name){...}
@json(name, schema-path){...}
@json(name, schema-name){...}
```

Inline bodies are evaluated as Nift templates before JSON parsing. A schema
name refers to an earlier JSON binding. Data and schema files are automatic
dependencies and paths must stay inside the project.

Use `@markup(format){...}` or `@markup(format, path)` for Markdown (`md`),
AsciiDoc (`adoc`) or reStructuredText (`rst`). Nift evaluates template syntax in
the source first, Markup++ converts it once, and the resulting HTML is appended
without being parsed as Nift syntax again. File sources and host-resolved
AsciiDoc/RST includes are automatic dependencies.

`@path(...)` creates project-aware links to tracked pages and local assets.

Nift has additional features including metadata, JSON data, loops, conditionals, pagination, contracts, and explicit dependencies. Use them when the project actually needs them; do not use advanced features merely because they exist.

When writing expressions inside constructs such as `@if(...)`, refer to values directly rather than wrapping them in `$[...]`. For example:

```html
@if(name == 'about'){...}
```

Use `$[...]` when resolving or rendering a value into output, for example `$[title]`. Consult the expressions and control-flow documentation when using more advanced expression syntax.

## Internal links: use `@path`

Use `@path(...)` for internal links.

This applies to:

- links between pages;
- stylesheets;
- JavaScript;
- images and other local assets where Nift should know the relationship.

For pages, link to the **tracked page name**, not its generated file.

```html
<nav>
    <a href="@path('/')">Home</a>
    <a href="@path('about')">About</a>
    <a href="@path('docs')">Docs</a>
    <a href="@path('contact')">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

Do this:

```html
<a href="@path('about')">About</a>
```

Do not do this:

```html
<a href="@path('about.html')">About</a>
```

and do not hard-code the generated output path:

```html
<a href="about.html">About</a>
```

The tracked page name is the stable project identity. Its output filename or location may change independently.

CSS and JavaScript includes should also use `@path(...)`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@path('public/assets/style.css')">
<script src="@path('public/assets/app.js')"></script>
```

Do not calculate relative paths such as:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../assets/style.css">
```

Using `@path` lets Nift resolve the correct output-relative path and check the project relationship during the build.

## Project configuration

`.nift/config.json` contains project-level Nift configuration.

`.nift/tracked.json` describes tracked pages and their metadata, including things such as their content, template, and output relationships.

By default, ordinary CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts and other static assets live
directly in the configured output tree (normally `public/`) and do not have
entries in `.nift/tracked.json`. Edit those files in place. This keeps Nift's
tracked graph focused on content that Nift actually renders and avoids duplicate
source/output copies for files that need no build-time transformation.

Track an asset only when Nift genuinely needs to generate it from content,
templates or build-time data. Template-less tracked entries remain available for
that advanced case; they are not the default asset workflow.

These files are part of the project and should evolve with its structure.

If you add, remove, or reorganise pages, templates, outputs, deployment settings, or other Nift-managed structure, inspect the relevant `.nift` configuration and update it where necessary.

Do not treat `.nift/` as disposable generated state.

Do not invent `.nift/tracked.json` fields or assume arbitrary fields become
`$[...]` metadata. When you need tracking behaviour or metadata that is not
already demonstrated by the project, consult the tracked-files and metadata
documentation rather than guessing.

## Output directory

Do not assume the generated website always lives in `public/`.

A normal Nift project may use `public/`, but deployment targets can use a different output structure appropriate to the platform.

Inspect `.nift/config.json` before making assumptions about output paths.

Edit Nift-managed page sources rather than their generated output. Edit untracked
static assets directly in the configured output tree, unless the project
documents another tool or source directory as their owner.

## Pagination

Pagination has several related pieces across `.nift/tracked.json`, page
content, pagination templates, and generated page links. Do not infer its full
behaviour from this handover.

If working with pagination, read the dedicated documentation first:

https://nift.dev/docs/pagination.html

Preserve the project's existing pagination structure unless the task actually
requires changing it, and run `nift build` frequently while doing so.

## Other stacks and tools

Nift does not need to own the whole application.

A project may use Nift alongside tools such as Vite, React, Vue, Svelte, TypeScript, Go, Node, Python, PHP, serverless functions, or other systems.

Keep responsibilities separated:

- use Nift for build-time composition, tracked relationships, and dependencies;
- use the neighbouring tool for the job it is designed to do.

Do not replace an existing stack with Nift-specific code simply to make more of the project use Nift.

## Before finishing

Run:

```sh
nift build
nift status
```

The build should succeed and `nift status` should report the project up to date.
Spot-check generated output when changes affect paths, templates, tracked
relationships, or deployment structure.

## Documentation

Nift documentation:

https://nift.dev/docs.html

When unfamiliar with the project, prioritise:

1. Getting started — https://nift.dev/docs/getting-started.html
2. the three-primitives/template-language material;
3. paths and tracked files, especially `@path`;
4. project structure;
5. `.nift/config.json` and `.nift/tracked.json`;
6. incremental builds and CLI commands.

Then read feature documentation only when the task requires it, for example:

- JSON and control flow;
- pagination;
- contracts;
- minification;
- deployment targets;
- integration with other application stacks.

Prefer documented Nift behaviour and the existing project structure over guessing based on another website generator or framework.

## Capgo report publication

Published `/sites/capgo/` and added it to the homepage and website catalogue. Distinguishes faithful human+agent migration from agent-native maintenance near the top; final repeated results, workload/cache caveats, corpus accounting, validation, maintenance tradeoffs and pinned evidence are included. Report owns dark charcoal/plum/ivory assets. Full measurements fit mobile rows. See `docs/CAPGO-PUBLICATION.md` for provenance and validation. Both experiment repos were left untouched.

## Maintenance analysis correction

Report-only investigation pushed to capgo-agent at 7d45594. Public case study now replaces unsupported content/component/i18n/integration superiority with concrete schema/discovery/compiler conveniences, separately deployed translation coverage, and Nift orchestration seams. Choices follow intended authoring/agent workflow; no unconditional retain-Astro recommendation. Experiment implementations and timings remain untouched.


## 2026-10-06 — graphs and visible iteration evidence

Added linear, zero-origin build-time and peak-process-memory graphs. Ordinary edits/no-op and explicit-target edits are visible, with workflow-specific maintenance recommendations. Three real edits per family for both migrations are recorded at capgo-agent b555abe (24 samples); historical ordinary cases are not paired with this new suite. Astro edit/HMR remains unmeasured. Faithful ordinary restoration left targeted test output in some cases; an unmeasured full rebuild restored complete parity. Cause remains unestablished; caveat and raw gates are published. No migration implementation changed.

## Deno Labs report publication

Added `/sites/deno/` with its own dark bone/olive circular pipeline identity, prominent common-edit feedback loop, complete publication/HTTP/browser/lifecycle acceptance, generated five-sample tables and visible workload/RSS/service qualifications. Source models remain distinct; the assessment prefers the Nift authored-source `deno` migration for both agent-led and mixed editing because authoritative source derives ancillary projections. Native changed-input production is explicitly separate from unmeasured dev-server behavior. Historical architecture/campaign results remain visible. See docs/DENO-PUBLICATION.md, retained JSON and responsive/link-validation ledgers. Completed Deno migration repositories and Nift core are untouched.

## AI SDK Labs publication

Added `/sites/ai-sdk/` with independent graphite/acid graph-and-trace assets, three explicit workflow labels, parity before performance, retained React islands, initial/rejected profiling, complete five-sample timing/memory and thirteen production input cases. Generated tables derive from pinned evidence, with Next production versus HMR, source coordination, memory and service boundaries visible. The judgement prefers Nift authored-source in both maintenance scenarios and calls for a serious deployment/backend evaluation. Guidance already allowed frameworks; discoverability and product ownership are the dogfooding lesson. Completed migrations and Nift core remain untouched. See docs/AI-SDK-PUBLICATION.md.

## Temporal Labs publication

Added `/sites/temporal/` with independent amber event-history assets, parity before performance, retained React islands, prominent production iteration and fresh-state ownership distinctions. Qualified memory scopes and initial/rejected evidence remain visible. The judgement prefers Nift authored-source for both maintenance scenarios and supports a bounded Docusaurus-to-Nift evaluation. See docs/TEMPORAL-PUBLICATION.md and responsive/link ledgers. Completed migration repositories and Nift core remain untouched.

## Dedicated report presentation

Temporal now uses an asymmetric event-history/replay system; website-generator uses a graphite/lime measurement rig. Accepted engineering content, values, caveats and evidence are retained. README.md records the family-versus-publication design convention. See docs/REPORT-REDESIGN.md for preservation and responsive gates. No migration repositories changed.


## TanStack.com bounded migration phase publication

Added `/sites/tanstack/` with its own boundary-map / branch-trace / tradeoff-rail design. Classifies the tested migration as unsuccessful/poor architectural fit, not Nift or TanStack generally. Preserves T10 historical results, T12 80 samples, full and incremental individual/tree RSS scopes, real parity/reproduction, rejected session/HTML-authority branches and the pending T11 replacement campaign. The `nift init --rewrite` experiment is planned and not started. No experiment implementation or core changes. See docs/TANSTACK-PUBLICATION.md and compact validation receipts.
